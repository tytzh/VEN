Paper: Scalable and Robust Energy Routing Optimization in Stochastic Vehicular Energy Network, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 2025.

This code is a lightweight implementation that focuses on the three core methods proposed in our paper:
1. Flow-guided graph reduction (our1)
2. Route-guided time-expanded graph construction (our2)
3. LSTM-MPC framework (our3)
These methods are modular and can be used individually or combined.

The input data is provided in '.mat' format as a reference example. Users can replace it with their own datasets as needed by following the same data structure.
